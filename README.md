# Module 3: Password-Generator

## Description
This password generator takes inputs from the user and returns a random string of digits. It asks the user to choose a password legnth and options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

In creating the logic behind the password generation, I was able to practice basic user input validation with while loops. I also practiced array and string manipulation.
